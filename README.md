# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
This project focuses on traffic sign recognition using machine learning and computer vision. The goal is to accurately identify and classify traffic signs from images, which is crucial for autonomous driving and road safety. By developing a reliable model, we aim to improve the ability of vehicles to recognize traffic signs and navigate safely.
